          <h2>Grab some snacks and check my story out!</h2>
          <p>My story begins in Makati, Philippines. I was born here and growing up we lived in a community where basketball was a big deal. Some people played it for fun and leisure but to me, it was something different. I fell inlove with the sport and found passion in it. I practiced long hours until I joined my high school varsity team where I was assigned as co-captain. I learned a lot of great values playing the sport which I can apply in daily life such as team work, leadership, humility and many more. Going in my senior year, I had to decide on which path I wanted to take in college. I've tried several hobbies and interests, but it was when my bestfriend introduced to me iOS development. I was not the best in coding but I enjoyed every single bit of it! To create something out of my fresh mind felt like I was playing God. I was coding and coding while not even realizing how time has passed and at that moment I knew this was what I wanted to do for my future.</p>
